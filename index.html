    <div class="aboutme-text"><h1> Coucou! </h1><p>Hi, my name is Alex and I am 25 years old. I live with my parents and my labrador, <a href="cookie.html">Cookie</a> in the South East of England.</p>
    
    <p> My favourite beverage of all time is tea; I like all sorts of flavours but you can find one of my recipes <a href="tea.html">here.</a></p>

    <p> During lockdown, I have been playing <b>Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</b> You can navigate through my blog for more AC inspiration <a href="animalcrossing.html">here.</a></p>

    <div class="coding"><h2>What inspired me to code?</h2>
    <p>I was made redundant due to the pandemic and I decided to reskill. Seeing as tech is hugely in demand, I decided to pursue coding.</p>
    <p>My experience with Code Nation has been an interesting one. During the 3 week course, I have learnt to build a text-based game with Python, and this website using HTML and CSS.</p></div>
