    <p class="i-love-tea">I love this lemon and ginger tea because of its unique taste. I am left feeling revitalised by each sip! Ginger and lemon are antioxidants which fight free radicals in the body. Honey can also be used to enhance sweetness and it also has antibiotic properties, making it a reliable hot beverage during the winter months. </p>
